ShinyCar
=================

* The name has absolutely nothing to do with what it does.
* It is  a small library for the HTML5 Storage API
* You can set objects as keys and values
* And, you can either use the ShinyCar object, or, add function to the Storage API itself.

Thanks for your interest in my project.
